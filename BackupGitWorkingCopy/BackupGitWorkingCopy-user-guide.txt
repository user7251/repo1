- This console app backs-up changed files and added files in a Git working copy.
- Motivation: Git does not have a way to backup changed files and added files in a working copy.  Many people use 
    "git commit" and "git push", but that pollutes the repo with backups.  Another option is to use "git diff", but 
    it has an issue with Visual Studio 2010 (VS).  Sometimes, VS saves C# files as UTF-8, sometimes UTF-16LE.  When 
    VS switches a file from one to the other, the "git diff" patch file says, "Binary files a/path1/file1.cs and 
    b/path1/file1.cs differ," and "git apply" fails to apply the patch.
- To backup:
    - Configure the paths in the BackupGitWorkingCopy class.
    - In "git bash," run "git status > git-status.txt"
    - Run this app.
- To restore, use Windows Explorer to copy (merge) the backup folder into the local git repo folder.
