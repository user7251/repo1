This console app backs-up uncommitted files (changed files and added files) in a Git working copy.

To backup your Git working copy, open Git bash and run:
$ git status | BackupGitWorkingCopy.exe "c:\your-repo" "c:\your-backup-root"

To restore a Git working copy, use Windows Explorer to copy/merge your backup folder contents into your local Git 
repo folder.

Motivation: Git does not have a way to backup uncommitted files (changed files and added files) in a working copy.  
Many people use "git commit" and "git push", but that pollutes your repo with backups.  Another option is to use 
"git diff", but it has an issue with Visual Studio 2010 (VS).  Sometimes, VS saves C# files as UTF-8, sometimes 
UTF-16LE.  When VS switches a file from one to the other, the "git diff" patch file says, 
"Binary files a/path1/file1.cs and b/path1/file1.cs differ," and "git apply" fails to apply the patch.
